    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">There are a number of practices in front-end development that are widely accepted. The practices are proven to be efficient. They include:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sanitization of data</b>
        <br>
        This practice involves ensuring that the data a system accepts is in the right format. This can be done manually or by using a well-known third-party solution. For example, in NodeJS, you have the sanitize-html package for sanitizing HTML code, and it is downloaded over a million times per week. There is also an ORM(Object Related Mapping) library for sanitizing the SQL related code.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Secure authorization and authentication</b>
        <br>
        This involves ensuring that authorization and authentication are hard to crack. This can be done manually but can be best achieved by using an open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin, Okta, etc.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Make use of a well-known third-party application.</b>
        <br>
        This involves ensuring that a third-party application is trusted and tested. One might need to carry out some research about the application before it can be used. An easier way to do that is to check how many downloads the application gets per week.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD)</b>
        <br>
        Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration is an automatic process of integrating and delivering code to production. Usually, CI/CD runs every change against some security checks and decides the delivery of the change to productions. Any change that does not pass the checks would be rejected and flagged for a rework. It basically catches oversights from developers and helps maintain the reliability of the changes coming to a codebase.
        <br>
        There are different CI/CD tools that teams across the globe integrate into their pipeline. They include Github Action, Jenkins, Travis CI, Circle CI, etc
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Network security </b>
        <br>
        A network is the connection of nodes via wired or wireless means in order to share data across nodes. Network security is the act of protecting the exchange of packets of data across the network.
        
        A network engineer is the one responsible for network security. However, a front-end developer must be wary of what network to connect to as well as where to host the website. Data could be compromised via the hosting platform.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Implementation of automatic user timeout</b>
        This involves protecting users who have left their credentials hanging in the browser for a long time. In most cases, this would be done by the backend team by setting a session for the expiration of the user credentials. However, as a front-end developer, you have to ensure that the API you are consuming has put this into consideration. </p>
