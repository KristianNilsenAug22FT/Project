    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">There are a number of practices in front-end development that are widely accepted. The practices are proven to be efficient. They include:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sanitization of data</b>
        <br>
        Make sure that the data or input your site accepts is in the right format.
        You can do this manually or use third-party solutions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Secure authorization</b>
        <br>
        Ensure that authorization is secure. Secure authentication of the user is important to make sure no one can hack into your site. You can also do this manually, but it is best that you use well known authorization solutions, like the industry-standard OAuth.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Use well know third-party apps</b>
        <br>
        If you use third-party solutions for your site, make sure they are well-known and do research to make sure it is safe to use.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>CI/CD</b>
        <br>
        Protect changes on your site by using Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration.
        With CI/CD every change you make to the site will have to go through security checks before delivering the changes to production.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Network security </b>
        <br>
        Be wary of where you host the site. Do research into the hosting service before choosing. If the hosting service has bad network security your data could easily be compromised on the hosting service.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Timeout</b>
        <br>
        Use automatic timeout for users. If the user has put in credentials or other info on the site, make sure the site times out the session after a given amount of time. This protects the user. </p>
